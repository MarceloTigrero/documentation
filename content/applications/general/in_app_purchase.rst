=====================
In-App Purchase (IAP)
=====================

In-App Purchases (IAP) are optional services that unlock new functionality in Odoo databases. For
example, the **SMS** service sends text messages to contacts directly from the database, and the
**Documents Digitization** service digitizes scanned or PDF vendor bills, expenses, and resumes with
optical character recognition (OCR) and Artifical Intelligence.

In order to use IAP services, an admin must first create IAP accounts for each service, and then
users must purchase IAP credits to spend on those services. Each service has its own pricing and
pack options listed on the `Odoo IAP website <https://iap.odoo.com/iap/all-in-app-services>`_.
